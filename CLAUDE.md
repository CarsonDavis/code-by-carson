## At Session Start
Read `INDEX.md` to understand the current state of the repository.

## After Any Work
Documentation is part of the deliverable, not a follow-up task. After completing
any coding work, immediately update all affected documentation before considering
the work done:

1. **INDEX.md** - Add/remove/update entries for any files that changed
   (new files, removed files, renamed files, changed purpose)
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** - Log what was built, how it was verified, and the result
3. **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Mark completed requirements, add new ones discovered during work
4. **Architecture/API docs** - Update if interfaces, data flow, or system design changed
5. **Any other linked docs** - If the work invalidates or changes what a doc says, fix it now

Do not move on to the next task until documentation reflects the current state of the code.
