# Note
I let Claude read my blog and a few other things and it wrote this honestly-not-terrible summary of me as a human being. It's missing some details and projects because I'm not quite chronically online enough...but damn.

# Carson Davis

Senior software developer in Huntsville, Alabama. Engineer by training, obsessive hobbyist by nature, and the kind of person who buys 120 film cameras and 25 whetstones before anyone can stage an intervention.

## Reading Profile

**639 books read. 929 in the library. Average rating: 3.55/5** (0.63 stars lower than the Goodreads average -- a tough grader who rates below the crowd 80% of the time).

### By the Numbers

### Reading Velocity

Steady 15-30 books/year from 2009-2022, then a massive jump: **120 in 2023, 140 in 2024, 107 in 2025** (with heavy audiobook use). On pace for another 100+ in 2026.

### What He Reads

**SFF dominates the fiction** (~36% of all books) but gets the lowest average rating (3.46). Carson reads a LOT of genre fiction and is ruthlessly critical of it. Top series: Stormlight Archive (19 Sanderson books), The Expanse (17 Corey books), Discworld (16 Pratchett), Wheel of Time (14 Jordan, read twice), plus deep dives into LitRPG/progression fantasy (Shirtaloon, Will Wight, Matt Dinniman).

**Nonfiction is where the 5-stars live.** Science, evolutionary biology, atheism/biblical scholarship, history, and health. The 2011-2013 period was a focused atheism-and-evolution binge (Hitchens, Dawkins, Ehrman, Sagan, Shubin, Sean Carroll). History gets his highest genre average (4.57).

**Japanese language and culture** is a persistent thread -- Genki textbooks (5 stars), Japanese children's books, Japanese novels, Japanese art books.

**Taste is maturing.** 2025-2026 shows a clear shift toward literary fiction: Ted Chiang, Ken Liu, Kazuo Ishiguro, Steinbeck, Daphne du Maurier.

**Loved more than average**: *The Forest of Wool and Steel* (+1.26), *Flying Spaghetti Monster* (+1.20), *The Old Man and the Sea* (+1.19), *I Have No Mouth* (+1.11)

### What He Praises in Reviews

- Books that teach something genuinely new
- Economy of language (short, punchy books often get 5 stars)
- Beautiful craft and design in art/reference books
- Compelling narrative woven through real information
- Emotional gut-punches

### What He Destroys in Reviews

- Bad character writing (the #1 killer -- "flat characters" and "cringe social interactions" sink many SFF books)
- Plot contrivances and logical holes
- Self-indulgent speculation and philosophizing
- Padding ("should have been 1/3 the length")
- Broken science in nonfiction ("fucks up enough basic science to make me question him")

## Writing & Personality

Carson writes like he talks -- casual, profane, self-deprecating, and genuinely helpful. He calls his own purchases insane, swears freely, addresses the reader directly, and buries rigorous analysis under layers of conversational humor. He provides budget, mid-range, and premium recommendations for everything. He measures shogi pieces with calipers and calculates variac efficiency curves for fun. His blog is equal parts teaching resource, personal journal, and evidence of a restless, deeply curious mind that cannot leave well enough alone.

**In short**: An engineer who reads 120 books a year, owns more cameras than some stores, and approaches every hobby with the intensity of a doctoral thesis and the narration style of a guy telling stories at a bar.
